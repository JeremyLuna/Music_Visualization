render/computation loop
-try to only grab a frame of samples once per animation frame

should I seperately band filter harmonics and add them in
or grab the banded versions found from detection stage and tile it.

implement specific frequency detection

add option for 1 to five harmonics.

max freq is not capped by calculated value

harmonics are not being merged into a waveform
waveforms are different lengths.

threshold needs nonlinear scaling and maybe scaling based on frequency, (higher frequencies are lower amplitude)
Maybe borrow this scaling for display as well

getting peaks at the edges of octaves
