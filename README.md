# Music_Visualization
To explore methods of feature extraction of music relavent to visualizing the experience of listening to music.

explore common synesthesia associations with music

wrapping can pe used to view octave alignment "notes"

logarithmic wrapping can be used to view harmonics and find the pitch of a note

color can visualize what harmonics are present (ie fundamental-blue, fifth-yellow, major-third-red), full sounds might be white-ish

a shockwave can be used to visualize impact

a bagdrop grid can visualize important intervals from the root

shadows can project at common intervals to visualize related notes to whats being played

size or some kind of spark effect can reflect volume of a sound

bass, percussive, and harmonic components can be visualized.

If a file is ready, a scroll can fall depicting what can be anticipated, this should be a setting that can be turned off for vizualising the experience of a blind listen
