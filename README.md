# Music_Visualization
To explore methods of feature extraction of music relavent to visualizing the experience of listening to music.

explore common synesthesia associations with music

wrapping can pe used to view octave alignment "notes"

logarithmic wrapping can be used to view harmonics and find the pitch of a note

color can visualize how strong harmonics and formants are present (ie fundamental-blue, fifth-yellow, major-third-red), full sounds might be white-ish

a shockwave can be used to visualize impact

a bagdrop grid can visualize important intervals from the root

shadows, outlines or lines can project at common intervals from played notes to visualize related notes to whats being played

size or some kind of spark effect can reflect volume of a sound

bass, percussive, and harmonic components can be visualized.

If a file is ready, a scroll can fall depicting what can be anticipated, this should be a setting that can be turned off for vizualising the experience of a blind listen

needs to be viewed at different timescales to see repetition, beats, measures, etc

want lots of controls for parameters

want option for weak computer real-time processing

need to compare Increase FFT resolution, parabola bin interpolation, (YIN, autocorrelation, or a phase‚Äêvocoded algorithms), or temporal tracking
